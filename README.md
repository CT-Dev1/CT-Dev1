Hi I'm CT-Dev1, I'm currently completing a masters in Applied Social Data Science at the London School of Economics.

For now, this github is focused on producing academic assignments pertaining to the completetion of my degree. 

Here are some of the completed projects you can find in my repositories:
- AI Model that uses a minimax algorithim with alpha-beta pruning to achieve near-optimal play in the 2-player game 'Chopsticks' (ST499) (Python)
- K-Means clustering algorithim for machine learning coded from scratch (MY470) (Python)
- Poker-playing AI that achieves near-optimal play through stochastic decision making (In Progress) (ST499)
- R-language web-scraping, API querying, data visualization (ggplot2) and tidy data management (tidyverse) (MY472)
- SQL applications for database management and data analysis

In the future, following further skill-gain in coding and data science, I aim to design an web-based application that provides class-level learning diagnostics for students in the game of chess. Chess learning provides numerous
meta-cognitive improvements which are not currently being maximized in the way it is taught. I've worked as a in-person chess teacher for 2 years and I see multiple avenues for improvement through a well-designed teacher-targeted platform.
I plan to use this project to deepen my knowledge of Java and web-development, as well as machine learning techniques within the area of education.

Please reach out if you feel like collaborating or sharing ideas on machine learning for education or the impact of AI for school-based teaching.
