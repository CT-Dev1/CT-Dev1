Hi I'm CT-Dev1, I'm a recent graduate in MSc Applied Social Data Science at the London School of Economics.

For now, this github has focused on producing academic projects pertaining to the completetion of my degree, these include class projects and my independent research projects such as my network analysis dissertation.

Some of the modules I've worked on through this github include:
- Artificial Intelligence (Python)
- Applied data science (SQL, R)
- Applied Machine Learning for Social Science (R)
- Social Network Analysis (R)
- Computer Programming (Python)

Some projects were completed in the past and were lated uploaded to this github to backfill my portfolio and project logbook, so some of my code is older than it may appear. My most recent project as of this commit is my msc dissertation, completed in August 2024. 

Here are some of the completed projects you can find in my repositories:
- Dissertation positing a new method to measure online social networks through state-of-the-art relational event modelling on Large-N dynamic networks (R)
- AI Agent model that uses a minimax algorithim with alpha-beta pruning to achieve near-optimal play in the 2-player game 'Chopsticks' (Python)
- Neural network for the short-term prediction of stock prices using logitudinal price data (Python)
- K-Means clustering algorithim for machine learning coded from scratch (Python) - To be added
- From-scratch network construction algorithm for wikipedia editing data optimized for efficiency, modularity and best coding practices (Python) 
- Full data pipeline investigation into police stop and search rates with web-scraping, API querying, tidyverse ecosystem (R + SQL)

These projects were mostly hand-coded. There was very little AI involved. This is to build my underlying knowledge (I've also find it fun and rewarding). 

I plan to add future data science and machine learning projects here in the future.
