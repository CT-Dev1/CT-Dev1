Hi I'm CT-Dev1, I'm a recent graduate in MSc Applied Social Data Science at the London School of Economics.

For now, this github has focused on producing academic projects pertaining to the completetion of my degree, these include class projects and my independent research projects such as my network analysis dissertation.

Some of the modules I've worked on through this github include:
- Artificial Intelligence (Python)
- Applied data science (SQL, R)
- Applied Machine Learning for Social Science (R)
- Social Network Analysis (R)
- Computer Programming (Python)

Some projects were completed in the past and were lated uploaded to this github to backfill my portfolio and project logbook.

Here are some of the completed projects you can find in my repositories:
- Dissertation positing a new method to measure online social networks through state-of-the-art relational event modelling on Large-N dynamic networks 
- AI Agent model that uses a minimax algorithim with alpha-beta pruning to achieve near-optimal play in the 2-player game 'Chopsticks' (Python)
- Neural network for the short-term prediction of stock prices using logitudinal price data (Python)
- K-Means clustering algorithim for machine learning coded from scratch (Python)
- R-language web-scraping, API querying, data visualization (ggplot2) and tidy data management (tidyverse) (MY472)
- Further projects that I'm backfilling since graduation 

These projects were mostly hand-coded. There was very little AI involved. This is to build my underlying knowledge (it's also a bit more fun if you have the time).
