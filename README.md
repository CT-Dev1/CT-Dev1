Hi I'm CT-Dev1, I'm a researcher in quantative methods at the London School of Economics. My speciality is in computational social science 

Here are some of the completed projects you can find in my repositories:
- Dissertation positing a new method to measure online social networks through state-of-the-art relational event modelling on Large-N dynamic networks (R)
- AI Agent model that uses a minimax algorithim with alpha-beta pruning to achieve near-optimal play in the 2-player game 'Chopsticks' (Python)
- Neural network for the short-term prediction of stock prices using logitudinal price data (Python)
- K-Means clustering algorithim for machine learning coded from scratch (Python) - To be added
- From-scratch network construction algorithm for wikipedia editing data optimized for efficiency, modularity and best coding practices (Python) 
- Full data pipeline investigation into police stop and search rates with web-scraping, API querying, tidyverse ecosystem (R + SQL)

These projects were mostly hand-coded. There was very little AI involved. This is to build my underlying knowledge (I've also find it fun and rewarding). 

I plan to add further data science and machine learning projects here in the future.
